# Retro!
####Retro! is a small 2D game featuring old school games like Pong and Breakout. Created in Unity 3D.

##About Project

This project started in 2014 - 2015,  during my senior year of college. I only managed to complete two games. Pong and Breakout. 
My intital goal was to create around at least 5 small games. Although, the creation of the first two games were harder than i expected.

Orginally the project was done on a <a href="http://www.bakeru.edu/">Baker University</a>  repository in 2014. I decided to bring to github
and make it open source for anyone to add games to and tweak. I'll will be adding more games to Retro! and can't wait to see what's in store!

##Installation for Demo

You can play the demo of Retro, by downloading the zip fils through Github.

After downloading, extract the files to an empy folder.

The main files you will need to run the game are:

- <b>Retro!.exe</b>
- <b>Retro!_data</b>

#Important! 
#### You cannot run the game without the Retro_data folder being in the same location as the exe.

#Installation for Edit

<b> Please create your own branch and test to make sure everything functions well. </b>

- Launch Unity 3D and select open folder.
- The folder you want to select is the "Pong" folder.  (This is the full Unity project folder)

Unity may ask you that this program needs to be upgraded to the newest version and will have to re-complie scripts and API data.
The game should still work. If any issues, please raise an issue on github.

After, the project should be loaded into Unity 3D and in the projects pane you should see the scences for the Main Menu, Breakout and Pong.

Go nuts on this project, this was meant for you to learn, but please <b>create your own Branch before editing the game.</b>
